    Performs a series of assertions to validate an application instance and its tools.

    This function checks for the following:
    - The application instance is not None.
    - The application instance's name matches the expected application name.
    - The application has at least one tool.
    - Each tool has a non-None name with a valid length (1-47 characters).
    - Each tool has a non-None description.
    - All tool names are unique within the application.
    - The application has at least one tool tagged as "important".

    Args:
        app_instance: The application instance to check. Must be an instance of BaseApplication.
        app_name: The expected name of the application.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the validation checks fail.
